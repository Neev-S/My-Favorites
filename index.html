      Every subjects are my favourite. Learning is benefical for me as it is
      base of who I will be in the future. My family is full of Doctors,
      Engineers and coders so I also can't fall behind. In learning, I love to:

      is one of 2 sports I like and good at the most. I had taken badminton
      classes in summer to improve my skills. I used to play on streets of
      Gujarat with my dad and here I am, playing with professional. I had played
      against a lot of grown and experienced adults and I did not dissapointed
      them but rather gave them the game they wanted. I might not be the best
      but I do have fast smashes.

    Chess is a game that most people understand but rather not play because its
    time taking. From the Opening to Middlegame to Endgame, I am an intermediate
    level player. I started to play with my dad and he was beating me every time
    but time changed and I took the other King over and over. Chess is another
    startegy game which help me to relax. Some of my Chess inspiration are:
    <ol>
      <li>Magnus Carlsen</li>
      <li>Levy Rozman</li>
      <li>Hikaru Nakamura</li>
      <li>Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa</li>
    </ol>
